### Project Overview
In this project, we explored the dataset recording 311 phone number for non-emergency services in New York City in 2020. Two peoblems were studied:
<li> What are the top 10 causes of calls to 311 are in our chosen ZIP code?
<li> Is illegal parking incidents a larger fraction of total 311 incidents in our ZIP code than they are in general?

<br /> The zip code we chose to analyze is 10025, an area near Columbia University campus. 
<br /> The results of our analysis are stored in two files: Top10.ipynb, and Parking.ipynb
